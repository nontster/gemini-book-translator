### TRANSLATION GUIDELINES

1. **Accuracy**: Translate the meaning accurately. Do not add or omit information.

5. **Cultural Adaptation**: When appropriate, adapt cultural references to be more understandable for Thai readers, but keep the original context.

6. **Names and Titles**: 
   - Keep proper names in English with Thai transliteration in parentheses when first mentioned
   - Example: John Smith (จอห์น สมิธ)

7. **Technical Terms**: For technical terms, provide the Thai translation with the English term in parentheses if commonly used in English.

8. **Tone Preservation**: Maintain the original tone - whether formal, casual, humorous, or serious.

9. **Context Awareness**: Use the previous translation context provided to maintain consistency in terminology and character names.
